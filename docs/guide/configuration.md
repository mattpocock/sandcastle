# Configuration

## Config directory (`.sandcastle/`)

All per-repo sandbox configuration lives in `.sandcastle/`. Run `sandcastle init` to create it.

## Custom Dockerfile

The `.sandcastle/Dockerfile` controls the sandbox environment. The default template installs:

- **Node.js 22** (base image)
- **git**, **curl**, **jq** (system dependencies)
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`)
- **Claude Code CLI**
- A non-root `agent` user (required — Claude runs as this user)

When customizing the Dockerfile, ensure you keep:

- A non-root user (the default `agent` user) for Claude to run as
- `git` (required for commits and branch operations)
- `gh` (required for issue fetching)
- Claude Code CLI installed and on PATH

Add your project-specific dependencies (e.g., language runtimes, build tools) to the Dockerfile as needed.

## Hooks

Hooks are grouped by **where** they run — `host` (on the developer's machine) or `sandbox` (inside the container):

```ts
hooks: {
  host: {
    onWorktreeReady: [{ command: "cp .env.example .env" }],
    onSandboxReady:  [{ command: "echo sandbox is up" }],
  },
  sandbox: {
    onSandboxReady: [
      { command: "npm install", timeoutMs: 300_000 },
      { command: "apt-get install -y ffmpeg", sudo: true },
    ],
  },
}
```

| Hook                     | Runs on | When                                         | Working directory                           |
| ------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `host.onWorktreeReady`   | Host    | After `copyToWorktree`, before sandbox start | Worktree path (host repo root under `head`) |
| `host.onSandboxReady`    | Host    | After sandbox is up                          | Worktree path (host repo root under `head`) |
| `sandbox.onSandboxReady` | Sandbox | After sandbox is up                          | Sandbox repo directory                      |

**Ordering:** `copyToWorktree` -> `host.onWorktreeReady` (sequential) -> sandbox created -> `host.onSandboxReady` + `sandbox.onSandboxReady` (parallel).

- **Host hooks** accept `{ command: string; timeoutMs?: number }` — no `sudo`, no `cwd`. Use `cd` or inline env in the command string.
- **Sandbox hooks** accept `{ command: string; sudo?: boolean; timeoutMs?: number }` — set `sudo: true` for elevated privileges.
- **`timeoutMs`** overrides the default 60 s per-hook timeout. Useful for long-running setup commands like dependency installs (e.g. `timeoutMs: 300_000` for 5 minutes).
- Within each hook point, sandbox hooks run in parallel; host hooks within `onSandboxReady` also run in parallel with sandbox hooks. `host.onWorktreeReady` hooks run sequentially in declared order.
- If any hook exits non-zero, setup fails fast.
- When a `signal` is passed to `run()`, it is threaded to all hooks — aborting the signal cancels any in-flight hook commands.
