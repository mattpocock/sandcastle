# Prompts

Sandcastle uses a flexible prompt system. You write the prompt, and the engine executes it — no opinions about workflow, task management, or context sources are imposed.

## Prompt resolution

You must provide exactly one of:

1. `prompt: "inline string"` — pass an inline prompt directly via `RunOptions`
2. `promptFile: "./path/to/prompt.md"` — point to a specific file via `RunOptions`

`prompt` and `promptFile` are mutually exclusive — providing both is an error. If neither is provided, `run()` throws an error asking you to supply one.

**Inline prompts (`prompt: "..."`) are passed to the agent literally.** No `{{KEY}}` substitution, no `` !`command` `` expansion, no built-in `{{SOURCE_BRANCH}}` / `{{TARGET_BRANCH}}` injection. If you need values interpolated into an inline prompt, build the string in JavaScript (`` `Work on ${branch}…` ``). Passing `promptArgs` alongside an inline prompt is an error — switch to `promptFile` to use substitution.

The substitution and expansion features below apply **only** to prompts sourced from `promptFile`.

> **Convention**: `sandcastle init` scaffolds `.sandcastle/prompt.md` and all templates explicitly reference it via `promptFile: ".sandcastle/prompt.md"`. This is a convention, not an automatic fallback — Sandcastle does not read `.sandcastle/prompt.md` unless you pass it as `promptFile`.

## Dynamic context with `` !`command` ``

Use `` !`command` `` expressions in your prompt to pull in dynamic context. Each expression is replaced with the command's stdout before the prompt is sent to the agent. All expressions in a prompt run **in parallel** for faster expansion.

Commands run **inside the sandbox** after `sandbox.onSandboxReady` hooks complete, so they see the same repo state the agent sees (including installed dependencies).

```markdown
# Open issues

!`gh issue list --state open --label Sandcastle --json number,title,body,comments,labels --limit 100`

# Recent commits

!`git log --oneline -10`
```

If any command exits with a non-zero code, the run fails immediately with an error.

Shell expressions inside HTML comments (`<!-- … -->`) are not run; they reach the agent as written. Use a comment to keep an example or a disabled command in the prompt.

## Prompt arguments with `{{KEY}}`

Use `{{KEY}}` placeholders in your prompt to inject values from the `promptArgs` option. This is useful for reusing the same prompt file across multiple runs with different parameters.

```typescript
import { run } from "@ai-hero/sandcastle";

await run({
  promptFile: "./my-prompt.md",
  promptArgs: { ISSUE_NUMBER: 42, PRIORITY: "high" },
});
```

In the prompt file:

```markdown
Work on issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}} (priority: {{PRIORITY}}).
```

Prompt argument substitution runs on the host before shell expression expansion, so `{{KEY}}` placeholders inside `` !`command` `` expressions are replaced first:

```markdown
!`gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --json body -q .body`
```

A `{{KEY}}` placeholder with no matching prompt argument is an error. Unused prompt arguments produce a warning.

`` !`command` `` expansion only runs on shell blocks written in the prompt file itself. Any `` !`…` `` pattern that appears inside an argument value is treated as inert text — it won't be executed against the host shell. This makes it safe to pass user-authored content (issue titles, PR descriptions, docs excerpts) through `promptArgs`.

## Built-in prompt arguments

Sandcastle automatically injects two built-in prompt arguments into every prompt:

| Placeholder         | Value                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{SOURCE_BRANCH}}` | The branch the agent works on (determined by the branch strategy) |
| `{{TARGET_BRANCH}}` | The host's active branch at `run()` time                          |

Use them in your prompt without passing them via `promptArgs`:

```markdown
You are working on {{SOURCE_BRANCH}}. When diffing, compare against {{TARGET_BRANCH}}.
```

Passing `SOURCE_BRANCH` or `TARGET_BRANCH` in `promptArgs` is an error — built-in prompt arguments cannot be overridden.

## Early termination with `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`

When the agent outputs `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`, the orchestrator stops the iteration loop early. This is a convention you document in your prompt for the agent to follow — the engine never injects it.

This is useful for task-based workflows where the agent should stop once it has finished, rather than running all remaining iterations.

You can override the default signal by passing `completionSignal` to `run()`. It accepts a single string or an array of strings:

```ts
await run({
  // ...
  completionSignal: "DONE",
});

// Or pass multiple signals — the loop stops on the first match:
await run({
  // ...
  completionSignal: ["TASK_COMPLETE", "TASK_ABORTED"],
});
```

Tell the agent to output your chosen string(s) in the prompt, and the orchestrator will stop when it detects any of them. The matched signal is returned as `result.completionSignal`.

### Hanging processes after the completion signal

The agent process is expected to exit shortly after emitting the completion signal. When a child it spawned — a `gh`/git subprocess, a long-lived MCP server, etc. — inherits the agent's stdout pipe and keeps it open, the parent process can linger long past its logical end. Sandcastle would otherwise wait for the full `idleTimeoutSeconds` and fail with `AgentIdleTimeoutError`, throwing away the commits the agent already made.

Instead, once the completion signal is observed in the output buffer, Sandcastle swaps in a short **completion timeout** (default 60 s). When it expires, the run resolves successfully with a warning that the process was hanging; `result.commits` and `result.completionSignal` are populated as if the process had exited cleanly. The timer resets on every subsequent output line, so trailing data emitted after the signal — token-usage events, terminal `result` events, a structured-output `<tag>` — is still captured.

A clean process exit always wins the race, so healthy runs gain zero added latency. The completion timeout only matters when the process hangs.

Tune the window with `completionTimeoutSeconds`:

```ts
await run({
  // ...
  completionTimeoutSeconds: 30, // shorter grace window
});
```

This is independent of `idleTimeoutSeconds`. They cover different phases: `idleTimeoutSeconds` runs **before** any signal is seen (genuinely stuck agent → fail); `completionTimeoutSeconds` runs **after** the signal is seen (hanging process → succeed with warning). See [ADR 0019](../adr/0019-completion-timeout-for-hanging-process.md).

## Structured output

Use `Output.object()` to extract a typed, schema-validated JSON payload from the agent's stdout. The agent emits its answer inside an XML tag you specify, and Sandcastle parses, validates, and returns it on `result.output`. The schema can be any [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) validator — the examples below use [Zod](https://zod.dev), but Valibot, ArkType, and others work identically. See [ADR 0010](../adr/0010-structured-output.md) for design rationale.

```ts
import { run, Output, claudeCode } from "@ai-hero/sandcastle";
import { docker } from "@ai-hero/sandcastle/sandboxes/docker";
import { z } from "zod";

const result = await run({
  agent: claudeCode("claude-opus-4-8"),
  sandbox: docker(),
  prompt: `Analyze the code, and output the result as JSON inside <result> tags.
    The result must match this schema:
    { summary: string; score: string }
  `,
  output: Output.object({
    tag: "result",
    schema: z.object({ summary: z.string(), score: z.number() }),
  }),
});

console.log(result.output.summary); // typed as string
console.log(result.output.score); // typed as number
```

`Output.string({ tag })` extracts the tag contents as a plain string (trimmed, no JSON parsing). Both helpers require `maxIterations` to be `1` (the default). The resolved prompt must contain the configured opening tag literal.

When extraction or validation fails, `run()` throws a `StructuredOutputError`. Alongside `tag`, `rawMatched`, `cause`, `commits`, `branch`, and `preservedWorktreePath`, the error carries the `sessionId` (and `sessionFilePath`, when the session was captured) of the run that produced the bad output.

Pass `maxRetries` to have Sandcastle handle the retry loop for you. Each retry resumes the same agent session and feeds back a token-efficient description of the error, so the agent can re-emit a corrected tag without redoing the work. Retries require an agent provider that supports session resumption (`claudeCode`, `codex`, `pi`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `opencode`) — every built-in agent provider resumes. Calling `run()` with `maxRetries > 0` against a custom provider without `sessionStorage` throws immediately.

```ts
const result = await run({
  agent: claudeCode("claude-opus-4-8"),
  sandbox: docker(),
  prompt: "Analyze the code and emit JSON inside <result> tags.",
  output: Output.object({
    tag: "result",
    schema: z.object({ summary: z.string(), score: z.number() }),
    maxRetries: 2, // 2 retries on top of the initial attempt
  }),
});
```

If you need to drive the retry loop manually — for example, to customise the feedback prompt or rotate models on each attempt — leave `maxRetries` at its default of `0` and resume the failed session yourself:

```ts
import { run, Output, StructuredOutputError } from "@ai-hero/sandcastle";

try {
  return await run({ ...opts, output });
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof StructuredOutputError && e.sessionId) {
    return await run({
      ...opts,
      output,
      resumeSession: e.sessionId,
      prompt: `Your previous output failed: ${e.message}. Re-emit it inside <${e.tag}> tags.`,
    });
  }
  throw e;
}
```

## Templates

`sandcastle init` prompts you to choose a sandbox provider (your OS's native sandbox, Docker or Podman), an issue tracker (GitHub Issues, Beads, or Custom), and a template, which scaffolds a ready-to-use prompt and `main.mts` suited to a specific workflow. If your project's `package.json` has `"type": "module"`, the file will be named `main.ts` instead. Choosing **Custom** scaffolds the project in a deliberately broken-until-configured state plus a `.sandcastle/SETUP_ISSUE_TRACKER.md` prompt you feed to your coding agent, which wires up your own tracker by editing the scaffolded files in place. Five templates are available:

| Template                       | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blank`                        | Bare scaffold — write your own prompt and orchestration                   |
| `simple-loop`                  | Picks issues one by one and closes them                                   |
| `sequential-reviewer`          | Implements issues one by one, with a code review step after each          |
| `parallel-planner`             | Plans parallelizable issues, executes on separate branches, then merges   |
| `parallel-planner-with-review` | Plans parallelizable issues, executes with per-branch review, then merges |

Select a template during `sandcastle init` when prompted, or re-run init in a fresh repo to try a different one.
